## Pre-installation
- Please, install both.
- PS: yarn is more flexible, but we are going to use both of them.
- To install NODEJS and NPM/Yarn:

- [Instal nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- [Instal yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

## Installation

```
    npm install -g @vue/cli
```

```
    yarn global add @vue/cli
```

## Create new vuejs porject (optional)

```
    vue create project_name
```

- Select `Vue 3`
- Select `Use Yarn`

To run the server (it will also build a project):

```
    npm run serve
```
OR


```
    yarn serve
```

## Manage project

There 2 options to manage the project (import/install dependencis, create new projects, etc)

- using terminal
- using Vue UI tool (good for begginers). To do so, just run this:

```
    vue ui

```

## Project Config

- Go check `package.json` file that contains project configuration. You can modify it according to your preferneces.

- In "scripts" you can see what commands you can run ( e.g run, build, lint)
